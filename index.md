Lonely Valley is a 7 Days to Die multiplayer server dedicated to PvE play. It is hosted on a dedicated server in [Online.net](https://online.net/en) [DC3 datacentre](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pdf/scaleway-dc3.pdf) near Paris, France. Fast connectivity, octa-core processor and a large RAM allocation helps to maintain a pleasant gaming experience.

The server has a variety of mods and facilities keeping the game experience tuned to the needs of PvE players. It is designated as a **Quiet Server** where the players respect each others right to play without interference.  

## Server Rules
The rules described below must be followed by every player. We try to maintain a pleasant gaming environment for everyone, without the need for constant intrusive moderation. This means that any failure to adhere to Server Rules will result in a ban.  The decision to exclude a player rests with the server owner and admins, and cannot be disputed. Please remember this and do not complain when the hammer lands on you.

### In-game Behaviour
1. **No player killing is allowed**, under no circumstances, with any weapon, explosive or trap. Should you wish to plant a landmine, dig a spike trap or whatever, put large signs next to it warning fellow players. Build a fence around the base, minefield or trap with the relevant signs waerning everyone to keep away. The warning signs must be placed _every 6 blocks or closer_ around the whole perimeter of the hazard. Don't worry, zombies can't read.
2. **You must not alter bases of other players** in any way. This includes destruction of blocks, taking any items from the land or buildings on the claim, alterations that change, obscure or prevent access to the base, or causing zombies to attack the base. 
3. **You must respect the right of other players to enjoy the game**. Please refrain from placing loudspeakers/sirens unless you are far, far away from anybody else. Do not spam the Global chat with your one-to-one conversations, create a party and invite a few people to it if you wish to talk at length. Do not stalk other players unless you were invited.
4. **Do not abuse glitches, bug, cheats or admin tools.** Any benefit obtained through these must be surrendered immediately, and any damage must be immediately rectified.

### Chat
5. No 18+ words or conversations.
6. No abuse, hate, politics, religion, scaremongering, bullying, deliberately offensive statements or prolonged arguments.
7. No real life personal details. 
8. No real life conversations that ruin game immersion in any way.

### Building
9. Do not build on or claim any POIs. Treat them in the same way as you would a player base. Hide on the roof if you wish but understand that other players may want to use it too. Move at least 70 blocks away from the POI in order to stake your claim.
10. Do not touch the roads, they are there for everyone.
11. Do not drop more than a few blocks, and particularly no drop mining.
12. Make sure you don't have more that 6 trees per LCB.
13. Have no more than 3 each of forges, campfires, workbenches, chemstations per base.
14. Do not build in reset zones, you will lose everything at the next reset.
