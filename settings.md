## Starting Out
When you first join the server you will find a quality 6 pistol and 20 of 9mm ammo in your backpack. Make sure you keep the last bullet for yourself. 

Night time starts at 22:00 and finishes at 04:00. Try to find a trader during daytime, you can hide in the trading outpost all night. They will kick you out at midday to clean the rooms etc, so you can say hello to the undead gathered around the perimeter. 

There is no lobby in this game, this is a battle for survival after all.

## Backpack
The size of the backpack on this server is set to 50!! Stack sizes are 20000 for blocks and 1000 for all other items.

## Biomes
Although the layout of biomes follows PREGEN02 map, enemy spawning settings for some biomes have been adjusted down as follows. Hostiles in all other biomes spawn as per vanilla settings.

| Biome             | Day spawn count   | Night spawn count |
| :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| Pine forest       | 0 zom 0 animals   | 1 zom 1 animal    |
| Desert            | 0 zom 1 animal    | 1 zom 1 animal    |

## Explosives
Due to the potential for abuse, all explosive block base damage has been set to 1. Furthermore, the entity damage for rockets of any kind is also set to 1. 

## POIs and Loot
Lonely Valley has all the main cities included in **reset zones**. Anything built or modified in such a zone will be cleared during reset. Quest POIs are similarly protected.

Cars, trees, rocks and boulders will all re-spawn, there is no need to plant forests or worry about the availability of materials.
